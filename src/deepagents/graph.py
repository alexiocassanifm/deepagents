## `write_todos`

You have access to the `write_todos` tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.
These tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.

It is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.
## `task`

- When doing web search, prefer to use the `task` tool in order to reduce context usage."""

    Args:
        tools: The additional tools the agent should have access to.
        instructions: The additional instructions the agent should have. Will go in
            the system prompt.
        model: The model to use.
        subagents: The subagents to use. Each subagent should be a dictionary with the
            following keys:
                - `name`
                - `description` (used by the main agent to decide whether to call the sub agent)

                - (optional) `tools`
                - (optional) `requires_approval` (bool): Whether this subagent requires plan approval
                - (optional) `approval_points` (list): Specific points where approval is needed
        state_schema: The schema of the deep agent. Should subclass from DeepAgentState
        enable_planning_approval: Whether to enable human-in-the-loop planning approval
        checkpointer: Checkpointer to use for state persistence. Can be:
            - "memory": Use InMemorySaver 
            - "postgres": Use PostgresSaver (requires configuration)
            - Custom checkpointer instance
            - None: No checkpointing (disables human-in-the-loop features)
        pre_model_hook: Optional function to process state before each LLM call.
            Useful for context compression, message filtering, or preprocessing.
            Function should take DeepAgentState and return modified DeepAgentState.
